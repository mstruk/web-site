<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The aim of this repository is to provide a template for the creation of new JBoss Community projects using <a href="http://awestruct.org">Awestruct</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. These are projects created and led by <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> who own the associated trademarks. To avoid unnecessary complexity and satisfy legal requirements users are kindly asked to observe the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This template should represent the majority view amongst users about the simplest and best way to create a website using Awestruct and Bootstrap (using LESS). It should strive to have the fewest dependencies and use the smallest number of template engines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes to the L&amp;F will be vetoed by the <a href="http://design.jboss.org">Visual Design Team</a> to ensure they meet branding guidelines and are consistent with the JBoss Community brand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project logos and other trademarked images must be hosted at http://static.jboss.org/[project]/images.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="fork-the-repository">Fork the repository</h2>
    <p>To use the template simply navigate to <a href="https://github.com/jbossorg/bootstrap-community">GitHub page</a> and use <em>Fork</em> button to fork this repository into your own GitHub organization. Afterwards choose a tag from which you want to start your website development and create a development branch from it. Additionally, in GitHub repository settings tab you may want to rename your forked repository to follow your site name.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part of the tag version number indicates the Bootstrap version the template is based on.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="build-the-website">Build the website</h2>
    <p>Run Awestruct in development mode from the top-level directory to build the website and host it using a local web server:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><code>bundle exec awestruct -d</code></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first time the site is built common JavaScript, font and image files will be downloaded from <a href="http://static.jboss.org">http://static.jboss.org</a> and cached into a local <em>cache/</em> directory using wget. This then allows you to run the site locally rather than relying on a network connection. Since the cache download takes a considerable amount of time by default the <code>wget</code> command will run only once a day to prevent unrequired delays in build times. The time interval and other settings of this process can be configured in site.yml.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the <code>--directory-prefix</code> option of the <code>wget: urls:</code> property in <em>_config/site.yml</em> if you wish to use a different directory name. A <em>.gitignore</em> file is automatically created in this directory containing a * to prevent you adding cached files to GIT by mistake.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="view-the-website">View the website</h2>
    <p>Use a web browser to visit <a href="http://localhost:4242">http://localhost:4242</a> where you can see the site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="addedit-web-pages-and-layouts">Add/edit web pages and layouts</h2>
    <p>Use a text editor to create/edit web pages and/or layouts. Use the <code>bootstrap_css_url</code> and <code>bootstrap_js_url</code> variables to ensure you refer to the locally built versions of the files in the development profile and the hosted versions in the staging and production profiles.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently the template uses images from an example project. If you wish to use your own project images then you must upload them to http://static.jboss.org/[project]/images, edit <code>project</code> and <code>project_images_url</code> variables and edit the <code>http://static.jboss.org/example/images/</code> line in the <code>wget: urls:</code> property, all three settings can be found in <em>_config/site.yml</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="customize-the-theme">Customize the theme</h2>
    <p>To use the theme simply reference the hosted <em>bootstrap-community.css</em> and <em>bootstrap-community.js</em> files on <a href="http://static.jboss.org">http://static.jboss.org</a>. However if you wish to make project-specific changes then test them locally using the development profile and host the compiled css and js files in your project-specific staging/production domains. Update the <code>bootstrap_css_url</code> and <code>bootstrap_js_url</code> variables in the staging/production profiles to refer to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="stage-the-website">Stage the website</h2>
    <p>Once you're happy with your website in development mode update the <code>profiles: staging: base_url:</code> property in <em>_config/site.yml</em> to point to your staging domain and run the <code>bundle exec awestruct -P staging</code> command to generate a version that can be uploaded for others to review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="publish-the-website">Publish the website</h2>
    <p>If everyone is happy with staging then update the <code>profiles: production: base_url:</code> property in <em>_config/site.yml</em> to point to your production domain and run the <code>bundle exec awestruct -P production</code> command to produce a version that can be uploaded for the public to view.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

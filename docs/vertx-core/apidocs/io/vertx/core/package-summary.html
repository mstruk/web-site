<div class="block">= Vert.x Core Manual
 :toc: right

 At the heart of Vert.x is a set of Java APIs that we call *Vert.x Core*

 https://github.com/eclipse/vert.x[Repository].

 Vert.x core provides functionality for things like:

 * Writing TCP clients and servers
 * Writing HTTP clients and servers including support for WebSockets
 * The Event bus
 * Shared data - local maps and clustered distributed maps
 * Periodic and delayed actions
 * Deploying and undeploying Verticles
 * Datagram Sockets
 * DNS client
 * File system access
 * High availability
 * Clustering

 The functionality in core is fairly low level - you won't find stuff like database access, authorisation or high level
 web functionality here - that kind of stuff you'll find in *Vert.x ext* (extensions).

 Vert.x core is small and lightweight. You just use the parts you want. It's also entirely embeddable in your
 existing applications - we don't force you to structure your applications in a special way just so you can use
 Vert.x.

 You can use core from any of the other languages that Vert.x supports. But here'a a cool bit - we don't force
 you to use the Java API directly from, say, JavaScript or Ruby - after all, different languages have different conventions
 and idioms, and it would be odd to force Java idioms on Ruby developers (for example).
 Instead, we automatically generate an *idiomatic* equivalent of the core Java APIs for each language.

 From now on we'll just use the word *core* to refer to Vert.x core.

 Let's discuss the different concepts and features in core.

 == In the beginning there was Vert.x

 NOTE: Much of this is Java specific - need someway of swapping in language specific parts

 You can't do much in Vert.x-land unless you can commune with a <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html" title="interface in io.vertx.core"><code>Vertx</code></a> object!

 It's the control centre of Vert.x and is how you do pretty much everything, including creating clients and servers,
 getting a reference to the event bus, setting timers, as well as many other things.

 So how do you get an instance?

 If you're embedding Vert.x then you simply create an instance as follows:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example1--"><code>CoreExamples.example1()</code></a>
 ----

 If you're using Verticles

 NOTE: Most applications will only need a single Vert.x instance, but it's possible to create multiple Vert.x instances if you
 require, for example, isolation between the event bus or different groups of servers and clients.

 === Specifying options when creating a Vertx object

 When creating a Vertx object you can also specify options if the defaults aren't right for you:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example2--"><code>CoreExamples.example2()</code></a>
 ----

 The <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/VertxOptions.html" title="class in io.vertx.core"><code>VertxOptions</code></a> object has many settings and allows you to configure things like clustering,
 high availability, pool sizes and various other settings. The Javadoc describes all the settings in detail.

 === Creating a clustered Vert.x object

 If you're creating a *clustered Vert.x* (See the section on the <<event_bus, event bus>> for more information
 on clustering the event bus), then you will normally use the asynchronous variant to create the Vertx object.

 This is because it usually takes some time (maybe a few seconds) for the different Vert.x instances in a cluster to
 group together. During that time, we don't want to block the calling thread, so we give the result to you asynchronously.

 == Are you fluent?

 You may have noticed that in the previous examples a *fluent* API was used.

 A fluent API is where multiple methods calls can be chained together. For example:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example3-io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest-"><code>CoreExamples.example3(io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest)</code></a>
 ----

 This is a common pattern throughout Vert.x APIs, so get used to it.

 Chaining calls like this allows you to write code that's a little bit less verbose. Of course, if you don't
 like the fluent approach *we don't force you* to do it that way, you can happily ignore it if you prefer and write
 your code like this:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example4-io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest-"><code>CoreExamples.example4(io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerRequest)</code></a>
 ----

 == Don't call us, we'll call you.

 The Vert.x APIs are largely _event driven_. This means that when things happen in Vert.x that you are interested in,
 Vert.x will call you by sending you events.

 Some example events are:

 * a timer has fired
 * some data has arrived on a socket,
 * some data has been read from disk
 * an exception has occurred
 * an HTTP server has received a request

 You handle events by providing _handlers_ to the Vert.x APIs. For example to receive a timer event every second you
 would do:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example5-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example5(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 Or to receive an HTTP request:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example6-io.vertx.core.http.HttpServer-"><code>CoreExamples.example6(io.vertx.core.http.HttpServer)</code></a>
 ----

 Some time later when Vert.x has an event to pass to your handler Vert.x will call it *asynchronously*.

 This leads us to some important concepts in Vert.x:

 == Don't block me!

 With very few exceptions (i.e. some file system operations ending in 'Sync'), none of the APIs in Vert.x block the calling thread.

 If a result can be provided immediately, it will be returned immediately, otherwise you will usually provide a handler
 to receive events some time later.

 Because none of the Vert.x APIs block threads that means you can use Vert.x to handle a lot of concurrency using
 just a small number of threads.

 With a conventional blocking API the calling thread might block when:

 * Reading data from a socket
 * Writing data to disk
 * Sending a message to a recipient and waiting for a reply.
 * ... Many other situations

 In all the above cases, when your thread is waiting for a result it can't do anything else - it's effectively useless.

 This means that if you want a lot of concurrency using blocking APIs then you need a lot of threads to prevent your
 application grinding to a halt.

 Threads have overhead in terms of the memory they require (e.g. for their stack) and in context switching.

 For the levels of concurrency required in many modern applications, a blocking approach just doesn't scale.

 == Reactor and Multi-Reactor

 We mentioned before that Vert.x APIs are event driven - Vert.x passes events to handlers when they are available.

 In most cases Vert.x calls your handlers using a thread called an *event loop*.

 As nothing in Vert.x or your application blocks, the event loop can merrily run around delivering events to different handlers in succession
 as they arrive.

 Because nothing blocks, an event loop can potentially deliver huge amounts of events in a short amount of time.
 For example a single event loop can handle many thousands of HTTP requests very quickly.

 We call this the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern[Reactor Pattern].

 You may have heard of this before - for example Node.js implements this pattern.

 In a standard reactor implementation there is a *single event loop* thread which runs around in a loop delivering all
 events to all handlers as they arrive.

 The trouble with a single thread is it can only run on a single core at any one time, so if you want your single threaded
 reactor application (e.g. your Node.js application) to scale over your multi-core server you have to start up and
 manage many different processes.

 Vert.x works differently here. Instead of a single event loop, each Vertx instance maintains *several event loops*.
 By default we choose the number based on the number of available cores on the machine, but this can be overridden.

 This means a single Vertx process can scale across your server, unlike Node.js.

 We call this pattern the *Multi-Reactor Pattern* to distinguish it from the single threaded reactor pattern.

 NOTE: Even though a Vertx instance maintains multiple event loops, any particular handler will never be executed
 concurrently, and in most cases (with the exception of <<worker_verticles, worker verticles>>) will always be called
 using the *exact same event loop*.

 [[golden_rule]]
 == The Golden Rule - *Don't Block the Event Loop*

 We already know that the Vert.x APIs are non blocking and won't block the event loop, but that's not much help if
 you block the event loop *yourself* in a handler.

 If you do that, then that event loop will not be able to do anything else while it's blocked. If you block all of the
 event loops in Vertx instance then your application will grind to a complete halt!

 So don't do it! *You have been warned*.

 Examples of blocking include:

 * +Thread.sleep()+
 * Waiting on a lock
 * Waiting on a mutex or monitor (e.g. synchronized section)
 * Doing a long lived database operation and waiting for a result
 * Doing a complex calculation that takes some significant time.
 * Spinning in a loop

 If any of the above stop the event loop from doing anything else for a *significant amount of time* then you should
 go immediately to the naughty step, and await further instructions.

 So... what is a *significant amount of time*?

 How long is a piece of string? It really depends on your application and the amount of concurrency you require.

 If you have a single event loop, and you want to handle 10000 http requests per second, then it's clear that each request
 can't take more than 0.1 ms to process, so you can't block for any more time than that.

 *The maths is not hard and shall be left as an exercise for the reader.*

 If your application is not responsive it might be a sign that you are blocking an event loop somewhere. To help
 you diagnose such issues, Vert.x will automatically log warnings if it detects an event loop hasn't returned for
 some time. If you see warnings like these in your logs, then you should investigate.

  Thread vertx-eventloop-thread-3 has been blocked for 20458 ms

 Vert.x will also provide stack traces to pinpoint exactly where the blocking is occurring.

 If you want to turn of these warnings or change the settings, you can do that in the
 <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/VertxOptions.html" title="class in io.vertx.core"><code>VertxOptions</code></a> object before creating the Vertx object.

 [[blocking_code]]
 == Running blocking code

 In a perfect world, there will be no war or hunger, all APIs will be written asynchronously and bunny rabbits will
 skip hand-in-hand with baby lambs across sunny green meadows.

 *But.. the real world is not like that. (Have you watched the news lately?)*

 Fact is, many, if not most libraries, especially in the JVM ecosystem have synchronous APIs and many of the methods are
 likely to block. A good example is the JDBC API - it's inherently asynchronous, and no matter how hard it tries, Vert.x
 cannot sprinkle magic pixie dust on it to make it asynchronous.

 We're not going to rewrite everything to be asynchronous overnight so we need to provide you a way to use "traditional"
 blocking APIs safely within a Vert.x application.

 As discussed before, you can't call blocking operations directly from an event loop, as that would prevent it
 from doing any other useful work. So how can you do this?

 It's done by calling <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#executeBlocking-io.vertx.core.Handler-io.vertx.core.Handler-"><code>Vertx.executeBlocking(io.vertx.core.Handler&lt;io.vertx.core.Future&lt;T&gt;&gt;, io.vertx.core.Handler&lt;io.vertx.core.AsyncResult&lt;T&gt;&gt;)</code></a> specifying both the blocking code to execute and a
 result handler to be called back asynchronous when the blocking code has been executed.

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example7-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example7(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 An alternative way to run blocking code is to use a <<worker_verticles, worker verticle>>

 == Verticles

 Vert.x comes with a simple, scalable, _actor-like_ deployment and concurrency model out of the box that
 you can use to save you writing your own.

 *This model is entirely optional and Vert.x does not force you to create your applications in this way if you don't
 want to.*.

 The model does not claim to be a strict actor-model implementation, but it does share similarities especially
 with respect to concurrency, scaling and deployment.

 To use this model, you write your code as set of *verticles*.

 Verticles are chunks of code that get deployed and
 run by Vert.x. Verticles can be written in any of the languages that Vert.x supports and a single application
 can include verticles written in multiple languages.

 You can think of a verticle as a bit like an actor in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model[Actor Model].

 An application would typically be composed of many verticle instances running in the same Vert.x instance at the same
 time. The different verticle instances communicate with each other by sending messages on the <<event_bus, event bus>>.

 include::verticles.adoc[]

 === Verticle Types

 There are three different types of verticles:

 Standard Verticles:: These are the most common and useful type - they are always executed using an event loop thread.
 We'll discuss this more in the next section.
 Worker Verticles:: These run using a thread from the worker pool. An instance is never executed concurrently by more
 than one thread.
 Multi-threaded worker verticles:: These run using a thread from the worker pool. An instance can be executed concurrently by more
 than one thread.

 === Standard verticles

 Standard verticles are assigned an event loop thread when they are created and the +start+ method is called with that
 event loop. When you call any other methods that takes a handler on a core API from an event loop then Vert.x
 will guarantee that those handlers, when called, will be executed on the same event loop.

 This means we can guarantee that all the code in your verticle instance is always executed on the same event loop (as
 long as you don't create your own threads and call it!).

 This means you can write all the code in your application as single threaded and let Vert.x worrying about the threading
 and scaling. No more worrying about +synchronized+ and +volatile+ any more, and you also avoid many other cases of race conditions
 and deadlock so prevalent when doing hand-rolled 'traditional' multi-threaded application development.

 [[worker_verticles]]
 === Worker verticles

 A worker verticle is just like a standard verticle but it's executed not using an event loop, but using a thread from
 the Vert.x worker thread pool.

 Worker verticles are designed for calling blocking code, as they won't block any event loops.

 If you don't want to use a worker verticle to run blocking code, you can also run <<blocking_code, inline blocking code>>
 directly while on an event loop.

 If you want to deploy a verticle as a worker verticle you do that with <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/DeploymentOptions.html#setWorker-boolean-"><code>DeploymentOptions.setWorker(boolean)</code></a>.

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example7_1-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example7_1(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 Worker verticle instances are never executed concurrently by Vert.x by more than one thread, but can executed by
 different threads at different times.

 ==== Multi-threaded worker verticles

 A multi-threaded worker verticle is just like a normal worker verticle but it *can* be executed concurrently by
 different threads.

 WARNING: Multi-threaded worker verticles are an advanced feature and most applications will have no need for them.
 Because of the concurrency in these verticles you have to be very careful to keep the verticle in a consistent state
 using standard Java techniques for multi-threaded programming.

 === Deploying verticles programmatically

 You can deploy a verticle using one of the <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#deployVerticle-io.vertx.core.Verticle-"><code>Vertx.deployVerticle(io.vertx.core.Verticle)</code></a> method, specifying a verticle
 name or you can pass in a verticle instance you have already created yourself.

 NOTE: Deploying Verticle *instances* is Java only.

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example8-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example8(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 You can also deploy verticles by specifying the verticle *name*.

 The verticle name is used to look up the specific <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/spi/VerticleFactory.html" title="interface in io.vertx.core.spi"><code>VerticleFactory</code></a> that will be used to
 instantiate the actual verticle instance(s).

 Different verticle factories are available for instantiating verticles in different languages and for various other
 reasons such as loading services and getting verticles from Maven at run-time.

 This allows you to deploy verticles written in any language from any other language that Vert.x supports.

 Here's an example of deploying some different types of verticles:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example9-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example9(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 === Rules for mapping a verticle name to a verticle factory

 When deploying verticle(s) using a name, the name is used to select the actual verticle factory that will instantiate
 the verticle(s).

 Verticle names can have a prefix - which is a string followed by a colon, which if present will be used to look-up the factory, e.g.

  js:foo.js // Use the JavaScript verticle factory
  groovy:com.mycompany.SomeGroovyCompiledVerticle // Use the Groovy verticle factory
  service:com.mycompany:myorderservice // Uses the service verticle factory

 If no prefix is present, Vert.x will look for a suffix and use that to lookup the factory, e.g.

  foo.js // Will also use the JavaScript verticle factory
  SomeScript.groovy // Will use the Groovy verticle factory

 If no prefix or suffix is present, Vert.x will assume it's a Java fully qualified class name (FQCN) and try
 and instantiate that.

 === How are Verticle Factories located?

 Most Verticle factories are loaded from the classpath and registered at Vert.x startup.

 You can also programmatically register and unregister verticle factories using <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#registerVerticleFactory-io.vertx.core.spi.VerticleFactory-"><code>Vertx.registerVerticleFactory(io.vertx.core.spi.VerticleFactory)</code></a>
 and <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#unregisterVerticleFactory-io.vertx.core.spi.VerticleFactory-"><code>Vertx.unregisterVerticleFactory(io.vertx.core.spi.VerticleFactory)</code></a> if you wish.

 === Waiting for deployment to complete

 Verticle deployment is asynchronous and may complete some time after the call to deploy has returned.

 If you want to be notified when deployment is complete you can deploy specifying a completion handler:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example10-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example10(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 The completion handler will be passed a result containing the deployment ID string, if deployment succeeded.

 This deployment ID can be used later if you want to undeploy the deployment.

 === Undeploying verticle deployments

 Deployments can be undeployed with <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#undeploy-java.lang.String-"><code>Vertx.undeploy(java.lang.String)</code></a>.

 Un-deployment is itself asynchronous so if you want to be notified when un-deployment is complete you can deploy specifying a completion handler:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example11-io.vertx.core.Vertx-java.lang.String-"><code>CoreExamples.example11(io.vertx.core.Vertx, java.lang.String)</code></a>
 ----

 === Specifying number of verticle instances

 When deploying a verticle using a verticle name, you can specify the number of verticle instances that you
 want to deploy:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example12-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example12(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 This is useful for scaling easily across multiple cores. For example you might have a web-server verticle to deploy
 and multiple cores on your machine, so you want to deploy multiple instances to take utilise all the cores.

 === Passing configuration to a verticle

 Configuration in the form of JSON can be passed to a verticle at deployment time:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example13-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example13(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 This configuration is then available via the <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Context.html" title="interface in io.vertx.core"><code>Context</code></a> object.

 === Accessing environment variables in a Verticle

 TODO

 === Verticle Isolation Groups

 By default, Vert.x has a _flat classpath_. I.e, it does everything, including deploying verticles without messing
 with class-loaders. In the majority of cases this is the simplest, clearest and sanest thing to do.

 However, in some cases you may want to deploy a verticle so the classes of that verticle are isolated from others in
 your application.

 This might be the case, for example, if you want to deploy two different versions of a verticle with the same class name
 in the same Vert.x instance, or if you have two different verticles which use different versions of the same jar library.

 WARNING: Use this feature with caution. Class-loaders can be a can of worms, and can make debugging difficult, amongst
 other things.

 Here's an example of using an isolation group to isolate a verticle deployment.

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example14-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example14(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 Isolation groups are identified by a name, and the name can be used between different deployments if you want them
 to share an isolated class-loader.

 Extra classpath entries can also be provided with <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/DeploymentOptions.html#setExtraClasspath-java.util.List-"><code>DeploymentOptions.setExtraClasspath(java.util.List&lt;java.lang.String&gt;)</code></a> so they
 can locate resources that are isolated to them.

 === High Availability

 Verticles can be deployed with High Availability (HA) enabled.

 TODO

 === Running Verticles from the command line

 You can use Vert.x directly in your Maven or Gradle projects in the normal way by adding a dependency to the Vert.x
 core library and hacking from there.

 However you can also run Vert.x verticles directly from the command line if you wish.

 To do this you need to download and install a Vert.x distribution, and add the `bin` directory of the installation
 to your `PATH` environment variable. Also make sure you have a Java 8 JDK on your `PATH`.

 You can now run verticles by using the `vertx run` command. Here are some examples:

 ----
 # Run a JavaScript verticle
 vertx run my_verticle.js

 # Run a Ruby verticle
 vertx run a_n_other_verticle.rb

 # Run a Groovy script verticle, clustered
 vertx run FooVerticle.groovy -cluster
 ----

 You can even run Java source verticles without compiling them first!

 ----
 vertx run SomeJavaSourceFile.java
 ----

 Vert.x will compile the Java source file on the fly before running it. This is really useful for quickly
 prototyping verticles and great for demos. No need to set-up a Maven or Gradle build first to get going!

 For full information on the various options available when executing `vertx` on the command line,
 type `vertx` at the command line.

 === Causing Vert.x to exit

 Threads maintained by Vert.x instances are not daemon threads so they will prevent the JVM from exiting.

 If you are embedding Vert.x and you have finished with it, you can call <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#close--"><code>Vertx.close()</code></a> to close it
 down.

 This will shut-down all internal thread pools and close other resources, and will allow the JVM to exit.

 === The Context object

 TODO

 === Executing periodic and delayed actions

 It's very common in Vert.x to want to perform an action after a delay, or periodically.

 In standard verticles you can't just make the thread sleep to introduce a delay, as that will block the event loop thread.

 Instead you use Vert.x timers. Timers can be *one-shot* or *periodic*. We'll discuss both

 ==== One-shot Timers

 A one shot timer calls an event handler after a certain delay, expressed in milliseconds.

 To set a timer to fire once you use <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#setTimer-long-io.vertx.core.Handler-"><code>Vertx.setTimer(long, io.vertx.core.Handler&lt;java.lang.Long&gt;)</code></a> method passing in the delay and a handler

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example15-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example15(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 The return value is a unique timer id which can later be used to cancel the timer. The handler is also passed the timer id.

 ==== Periodic Timers

 You can also set a timer to fire periodically by using <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#setPeriodic-long-io.vertx.core.Handler-"><code>Vertx.setPeriodic(long, io.vertx.core.Handler&lt;java.lang.Long&gt;)</code></a>.

 There will be an initial delay equal to the period.

 The return value of `setPeriodic` is a unique timer id (long). This can be later used if the timer needs to be cancelled.

 The argument passed into the timer event handler is also the unique timer id:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example16-io.vertx.core.Vertx-"><code>CoreExamples.example16(io.vertx.core.Vertx)</code></a>
 ----

 ==== Cancelling timers

 To cancel a periodic timer, call <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#cancelTimer-long-"><code>Vertx.cancelTimer(long)</code></a> specifying the timer id. For example:

 [source,java]
 ----
 <a href="../../../examples/CoreExamples.html#example17-io.vertx.core.Vertx-long-"><code>CoreExamples.example17(io.vertx.core.Vertx, long)</code></a>
 ----
 == Buffers

 [[event_bus]]
 == Getting a reference to the event bus

 Use <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#eventBus--"><code>Vertx.eventBus()</code></a> to get a reference to the event bus.

 The link:eventbus.html[event bus API manual] has full details on the API.

 == Creating HTTP Clients and Servers

 You create <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/http/HttpClient.html" title="interface in io.vertx.core.http"><code>HttpClient</code></a> instances using the method <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#createHttpClient-io.vertx.core.http.HttpClientOptions-"><code>Vertx.createHttpClient(io.vertx.core.http.HttpClientOptions)</code></a>.

 You create <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/http/HttpServer.html" title="interface in io.vertx.core.http"><code>HttpServer</code></a> instances using the method <a href="../../../io/vertx/core/Vertx.html#createHttpServer-io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerOptions-"><code>Vertx.createHttpServer(io.vertx.core.http.HttpServerOptions)</code></a>.

 The link:http.html[HTTP API Manual] explains all about using HTTP with Vert.x.
